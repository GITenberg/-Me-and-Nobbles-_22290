description: Bobby loves to look through the old Italian leather Bible in his house.  His
  favorite page is the picture of the golden gates guarded by angels, and the happy
  people all dressed in white robes.  But Bobby wonders about the crying people kept
  outside, and he is determined to find out how he can get a clean white robe to enter
  those golden gates.
